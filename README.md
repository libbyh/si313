# Overview

Welcome! This repository hosts code and data used during in-class demos in SI 313: Introduction to Quantitative Methods. Many of the demos are Python versions of the demos and exercises provided in the class textbook:

> Chapman, C., Rodden, K. (2023). _Quantitative User Experience Researchâ€¯: Informing Product Decisions by Understanding Users at Scale_. Apress.

The original code and data that accompany the book are available at [the book's website](https://quantuxbook.com/index.html).

# Getting Started

We will (usually) assume that you're using VS Code to run your notebooks and code.

## Setting up VS Code

Here's a screen recording of me setting up my VS Code environment. First, I clone the repo, then I create a virtual environment and install the modules I need to run the code.

[![Here's a screen recording that shows how to setup your VS Code](https://img.youtube.com/vi/utshQfeDbWw/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/embed/utshQfeDbWw)

## Setting your paths

Before running any of the notebooks, you should start with [notebooks/start_here.ipynb](notebooks/start_here.ipynb) to make sure your path is setup correctly.

## 1. How to get Python and Jupyter extensions into VSCode

Step 1. Go to Extensions tab on left-side of VSCode

Step 2. Search for the Python extension from Microsoft and install

<img title="python_extension" alt="python extension page" src="./images/python_ext.png" width = "750">

Step 3. Search for the Jupyter extension from Microsoft and install

<img title="jupyter_extension" alt="jupyter extension page" src="./images/jupyter_ext.png" width = "750">


## 2. How to create a new Jupyter notebook file

Step 1. Select the Explorer on the left of VSCode

<img title="explorer_button" alt="explorer tab in VSCode" src="./images/explorer_icon.png" width = "25">

Step 2. Open a folder/directory if none appears in the Explorer box 

<img title="explorer_box_no_folder" alt="Explorer box with no folder open in VSCode" src="./images/explorer_box.png" width = "200">

Step 3. Mouse over the directories in the Explorer box

Step 4. Click the page with a plus icon to create a file and input a name ending with the Jupyter notebook file extension (ex. "filename.ipynb")

## 3. How to create a virtual environment

Step 0. Why to create a virtual environment
- A virtual environment helps with switching between versions of modules across projects and protecting your base interpreters from corrupted files or conflicting versions

Step 1. In a new Jupyter notebook file, click "Select Kernel" in top right of VSCode

<img title="Select Kernel button" alt="Select Kernel button in new Jupyter notebook" src="./images/kernel_button.png" height = "200">

Step 2. Select "Select Another Kernel..."

Step 3. Select the plus line that says "Create Python Environment" 

Step 4. Select "Venv" to create a virtual environment

Step 5. Select desired Python interpreter (version of Python, see 4.)

## 4. How to install a Python interpreter (depends on Mac vs. Windows/Linux)

### If Mac, 
Step 1. Visit <a href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew webpage</a> and follow instructions to install

Step 2. Install a version of Python (ideally 3.12 or later) using "brew install python" in Terminal

### If Windows/Linux,
Step 1. Visit  <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">Python webpage</a>

Step 2. Download appropriate .exe file, then run once downloaded

Step 3. Note filepath where Python is installed to

## 4a. How to specify which module versions the interpreter/virtual environment should include
- When creating the virtual environment, after selecting the desired Python interpreter, select a textfile with module versions specified
- For this class, we'll use the versions in requirements.txt
