The original code and data that accompany the book are available at [the book's website](https://quantuxbook.com/index.html).

# Getting Started

We will (usually) assume that you're using VS Code to run your notebooks and code.

## Setting up VS Code

[![Here's a screen recording that shows how to setup your VS Code](https://img.youtube.com/vi/utshQfeDbWw/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/embed/utshQfeDbWw)

## Setting your paths

Before running any of the notebooks, you should start with [notebooks/start_here.ipynb](notebooks/start_here.ipynb) to make sure your path is setup correctly.
